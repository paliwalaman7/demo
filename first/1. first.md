# Intro

## Subheading
You are given a 0-indexed integer array stones sorted in strictly increasing order representing the positions of stones in a river. A frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone at most once. The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

Explanation: The above figure represents one of the optimal paths the frog can take.
The cost of this path is 5, which is the maximum length of a jump.
Since it is not possible to achieve a cost of less than 5, we return it.
